# 3ddnascoreA
3dDNAscoreA is an all-atom energy function 3dDNAscoreA for evaluation of DNA 3D structures based on a deep learning model of ARES for RNA 3D structure evaluation but uses a new training strategy that uses the DNA training sets within a RMSD thresholds to train the model,  which is an extension of our RNA 3D structure prediction method 3dRNA (http://biophy.hust.edu.cn/new/3dRNA/create).
